# Cloud Infrastructure Standards - Definition of Done

Engineering Company Cloud Operations Baseline  
Version 1.0 - July 22, 2025

## Overview

This document establishes the minimum security and operational requirements for cloud resources across Azure and AWS platforms. All cloud deployments must meet these standards before being considered "done" and ready for production use. These standards ensure consistent, secure, and well-operated cloud infrastructure across all engineering teams.

## 1. Security

### Identity and Access Management

- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled for all privileged accounts
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) with least privilege principles
- [ ] Service principals/managed identities used for automation (no user accounts)
- [ ] Regular access reviews scheduled (quarterly)

### Network Security

- [ ] Virtual networks properly segmented with private/public subnet design
- [ ] Network security groups configured with deny-by-default rules
- [ ] Private endpoints used for PaaS services where available
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF) deployed for public applications

### Data Protection

- [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit enabled (TLS 1.2 minimum)
- [ ] Customer-managed keys implemented where required
- [ ] Data classification applied with appropriate access controls
- [ ] Database access restricted to application subnets only

## 2. Monitoring and Observability

### Core Monitoring

- [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM) and infrastructure monitoring implemented
- [ ] Health check endpoints and probes configured for all services
- [ ] Centralized logging with minimum 90-day retention
- [ ] Security monitoring integrated (Azure Security Center/AWS Security Hub)

### Alerting and Response

- [ ] Critical system alerts configured with defined escalation paths
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Performance baselines established with SLA definitions

## 3. Operations and Deployment

### Deployment and Maintenance

- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) used for all deployments
- [ ] Automated backup strategy with tested restoration procedures
- [ ] Patch management strategy implemented with maintenance windows
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment capability (rolling updates, blue-green)

### Scalability and Performance

- [ ] Auto-scaling policies configured and tested
- [ ] Load testing performed with documented performance budgets
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan with defined RTO/RPO objectives
- [ ] Multi-zone deployment for critical services

## 4. Governance and Compliance

### Policy and Standards

- [ ] Cloud governance policies enforced (Azure Policy/AWS Config)
- [ ] Resource tagging standards implemented
- [ ] Cost management and budgeting alerts configured
- [ ] Security baselines applied and compliance validated

### Documentation and Knowledge

- [ ] Architecture documentation maintained (diagrams, ADRs)
- [ ] Standard operating procedures (SOPs) documented
- [ ] On-call procedures and troubleshooting guides available
- [ ] Team cross-training completed for critical systems

## 5. Platform-Specific Setup

### Azure Deployments

- [ ] Microsoft Defender for Cloud enabled
- [ ] Azure Key Vault used for secrets management
- [ ] Azure Security Benchmark compliance validated

### AWS Deployments

- [ ] AWS GuardDuty and Security Hub enabled
- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager used for secrets management
- [ ] AWS Well-Architected Framework review completed

## 6. Pipeline and Change Control

### Pipeline Security

- [ ] Security scanning integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Infrastructure code security validation
- [ ] Secrets scanning and secure configuration management
- [ ] Automated testing including security tests

### Change Management

- [ ] All changes tracked in version control
- [ ] Change approval and rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Post-deployment validation procedures defined

## Approval and Sign-off

- [ ] Security team review completed
- [ ] Architecture review completed  
- [ ] Business stakeholder approval obtained
