# Writing Principles for Cloud Infrastructure Standards

Guidelines for creating clear, actionable documentation

## Core Philosophy

Write standards that define **what the job done is**, not how well it is done. If we've not met the standard, we've not done it.

## Principles

### 1. Direct, Not Performative

- **Use concrete job descriptions** instead of aspirational language
- **Avoid buzzwords** that don't add concrete meaning
- **Say what needs to be done**, not how "excellent" it should be
- **Examples:**
  - ❌ "Operational Excellence" → ✅ "Operations and Deployment"
  - ❌ "Security Fundamentals" → ✅ "Security"
  - ❌ "DevSecOps Integration" → ✅ "Pipeline and Change Control"

### 2. Binary Completion

- Each requirement is either **done or not done**
- No subjective quality judgments
- No relative terms like "good" or "better"
- Clear threshold: unchecked = job not done

### 3. Job-Focused Language

- Focus on the **work that needs completing**
- Describe **concrete tasks and configurations**
- Avoid industry jargon that obscures meaning
- Use language that tells people exactly what to do

### 4. Practical Over Inspirational

- Standards should be **actionable checklists**, not motivation
- Each item should be **testable and verifiable**
- Avoid language that sounds impressive but lacks specificity
- Focus on **completion criteria**, not aspirational goals

### 5. Honest Communication

- Don't make things sound better than they are
- Avoid inflated language that doesn't match reality
- Call things what they actually are
- Be accurate, not promotional

## Application

When writing or reviewing standards:

1. **Ask: "What exactly needs to be done?"**
2. **Remove performative adjectives** (excellent, best-practice, world-class)
3. **Use concrete verbs** (configured, implemented, documented, tested)
4. **Test for clarity**: Can someone read this and know exactly what to do?
5. **Check for honesty**: Does this language match the actual work required?

## Result

Documentation that helps teams **get work done** rather than **sound impressive**.
