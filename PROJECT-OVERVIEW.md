# Project Overview

Enterprise Infrastructure as Code Toolkit for consistent, scalable cloud deployments.

## What This Project Provides

### Core Value

- **Fast Setup**: DevContainer with all tools pre-configured
- **Enterprise Standards**: Built-in security and compliance validation  
- **Local-First Development**: Test everything before deploying
- **Consistent Environment**: Same toolchain for everyone
- **Clear Standards**: Binary completion criteria for all infrastructure

### Key Components

- **Infrastructure Modules**: Reusable Terraform components for enterprise patterns
- **Validation Framework**: Local testing and compliance checking before deployment
- **DevContainer Environment**: Consistent development setup with minimal local dependencies
- **Enterprise Standards**: Security, operational, and governance requirements
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated pipeline templates for infrastructure deployments

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and open in VS Code**: Repository will prompt to reopen in container
2. **Wait for setup**: 2-3 minutes for automated tool installation  
3. **Configure environment**: Edit `local-validation-config.json`
4. **Start developing**: Run `make validate-dry` to test setup

See [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start.md) for detailed instructions.

## Enterprise Use Cases

### Infrastructure Teams

- **Standardized modules** for common infrastructure patterns
- **Local validation** prevents deployment failures
- **Compliance automation** enforces enterprise security standards
- **DevContainer isolation** works on locked-down corporate machines

### Development Teams  

- **Self-service infrastructure** through validated Terraform modules
- **Fast feedback loops** with local testing before cloud deployment
- **Consistent environments** eliminate "works on my machine" issues
- **Clear documentation** with concrete examples and validation steps

### Platform Teams

- **Subscription vending** automation for new environments
- **Policy enforcement** through Azure Policy and validation scripts
- **Monitoring integration** with standardized logging and alerting
- **Change management** through validated pipeline workflows

## Architecture Principles

### Local-First Development

All infrastructure changes validated locally before deployment:

```bash
make validate-dry    # Fast validation during development
make validate        # Full validation including Azure checks  
make test           # Comprehensive testing suite
```

### Container-Based Tooling

- **No local dependencies**: All tools run inside DevContainer
- **Performance optimized**: Linux filesystem for fast Terraform operations
- **Portable**: Same environment on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Corporate friendly**: Minimal impact on locked-down systems

### Module-Driven Architecture

- **Reusable components**: Tested infrastructure patterns
- **Enterprise standards**: Security and operational requirements built-in
- **Clear interfaces**: Well-defined inputs and outputs
- **Documentation**: README and examples for each module

## Project Status
